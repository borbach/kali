To use the alpine linux system in a usb port to throw control to kali linux on a sd card, do the following.
1. Place a kali linux sd card in the sd card slot.
2. gdisk the alpine sd card, creating a GPT and use n to create one partition of type EFI efoo.
3. Go to expert attributes and make it a legacy BIOS boot.
4. Write the result.
5. mkfs.vfat -F 32 /dev/sda or whatever.
6. Download the alpine iso.
7. Copy it to an alpine directory.
7. 7zip it out 7z x alpine.iso
8. copy the kali /boot/initrd.img and vmlinuz files to the boot directory in the alpine directory.
9. blkid to get the root UUID of the kali linux sd card.
10. Place it in the grub.cfg file as follows:
6. Download the alpine iso.
7. Copy it to an alpine directory.
7. 7zip it out 7z x alpine.iso
8. copy the kali /boot/initrd.img and vmlinuz files to the boot directory in the alpine directory.
9. blkid to get the root UUID of the kali linux sd card.
10. Place it in the grub.cfg file as follows:
6. Download the alpine iso.
7. Copy it to an alpine directory.
7. 7zip it out 7z x alpine.iso
8. copy the kali /boot/initrd.img and vmlinuz files to the boot directory in the alpine directory.
9. blkid to get the root UUID of the kali linux sd card.
10. Place it in the grub.cfg file as follows:
6. Download the alpine iso.
7. Copy it to an alpine directory.
7. 7zip it out 7z x alpine.iso
8. copy the kali /boot/initrd.img and vmlinuz files to the boot directory in the alpine directory.
9. blkid to get the root UUID of the kali linux sd card.
10. Place it in the grub.cfg file as follows:
6. Download the alpine iso.
7. Copy it to an alpine directory.
7. 7zip it out 7z x alpine.iso
8. copy the kali /boot/initrd.img and vmlinuz files to the boot directory in the alpine directory.
9. blkid to get the root UUID of the kali linux sd card.
10. Place it in the grub.cfg file as follows:
6. Download the alpine iso.
7. Copy it to an alpine directory.
7. 7zip it out 7z x alpine.iso
8. copy the kali /boot/initrd.img and vmlinuz files to the boot directory in the alpine directory.
9. Rename them to vmlinuz-kali and initrd.img.kali.
10. blkid to get the root UUID of the kali linux sd card.
11. Place it in the grub.cfg file as follows:

set timeout=5
set default=1

#menuentry "Linux lts" {
#linux	/boot/vmlinuz-lts modules=loop,squashfs,sd-mod,usb-storage  
#initrd	/boot/intel-ucode.img /boot/amd-ucode.img /boot/initramfs-lts
#}
menuentry "Kali Linux with UUID" {
echo "Loading vmlinuz with UUUID..."
linux	/boot/vmlinuz-kali root=UUID=becf42b4-075c-4329-a9d7-69e97f1a62bb modules=loop,squashfs,sd-mod,usb-storage  
echo "Loading image file with UUID..."
initrd	/boot/initrd.img.kali
}
menuentry "Kali Linuxi with /dev/mmcblk0p3" {
echo "Loading vmlinuz with /dev/mmcblk0p3..."
linux	/boot/vmlinuz-kali root=/dev/mmcblk0p3 modules=loop,squashfs,sd-mod,usb-storage  
echo "Loading image file with /dev/mmcblk0p3..."
initrd	/boot/initrd.img.kali
}


12. mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/root
13. Remove the alpine.iso file from the alpine directory.
14. cp -r /home/bill/Downloads/alpine/* /mnt/root


Also remember to remove the snapd daemon with "apt purge snapd"
and rm -rf anaconda3 from the /home/bill directory.
