First download the required files:
On the asus14 (BIOS) computer do the following:
Sudo apt install grub-pc
On the asus16 computer (UEFI) do the following:
Sudo apt install grub-efi-amd64
You should also get an i386-efi grub module if it is available
This may have to be done on different computers,depending on the configuration of the computer, such as a BIOS computer with MBR, a UEFI computer with GPT, etc.


Then use gdisk to create 4 partitions, a 2 M partition on the sector closest to the beginning of the disk - 2048 but prefer it to be 1.
Then an EFI partition of 500M
Then a boot partition of 500M
Then a data partition of the rest of the disk.
In addition to the GPT, also create an MBR in the expert menu of GPT and include the first 3 partitions.


Mkfs.vfat /dev/sda1
Mkfs.vfat /dev/sda2
Mkfs.vfat /dev/sda3
Mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda4




mount /dev/sda3 /mnt/boot
mkdir /mnt/boot/boot
mount /dev/sda2 /mnt/efi

Make sure the target sd card is on the asus-16 (UEFI) cpmputer when you type the following
grub-install --target=x86_64-efi --removable --no-nvram \
  --root-directory=/mnt/boot \
  --boot-directory=/mnt/boot/boot \
  --efi-directory=/mnt/efi

Make sure that the target SD card is on the asus14 (BIOS) computer when you do the following:
grub-install --target=i386-efi --removable --no-nvram \
  --root-directory=/mnt/boot \
  --boot-directory=/mnt/boot/boot \
  --efi-directory=/mnt/efi


grub-install --target=i386-pc \
  --root-directory=/mnt/boot \
  --boot-directory=/mnt/boot/boot \
  /dev/sdc


umount /mnt/efi
copy the /boot/grub/grub.cfg file to /mnt/boot/boot/grub
You need to change the grub.cfg file to have the right partition identifiers and also edit the /etc/fstab which will be in /mnt/root


mount /dev/sda4 /mnt/root


copy all the linux files to /mnt/root or dd the / partition for a working linux system.
edit the /etc/fstab file to have the correct partition ids.

If there is a problem with no sound, first use alsamixer <F6> to choose the sound card, then make sure to unmute all speakers and headphone with M and increase the volume with arrow keys.
Then use "systemctl restart --user wireplumber.service"
